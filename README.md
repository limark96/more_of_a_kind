## A cute 3D Puzzle Platformer with a twist
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A typical action platformer usually lets its player control a single character, but what if we were to let the player control 6 or 7 characters at the same time? "More of Kind" explores this idea by increasing the number of characters the player controls as the game progresses, presenting the player with a variety of challenges based on very simple rules and mechanics. </p>
