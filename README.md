# more_of_a_kind
This repository holds the code I have written for my game project "More of A Kind"

A typical action platformer usually lets its player controls a single character. What if we were to let the player control 6 or 7 characters at the same time? "More of Kind" explores this idea by increasing the number of characters the player controls as the game progresses, presenting the player with a variety of challenges based on very simple rules and mechanics.
